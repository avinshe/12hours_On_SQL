# My 12-hour Experience On SQL

I'm a civil engineer who worked on SQL related roles for 5 years. Now, I am doing my masters in data science. My roommates and friends have not had prior professional work experience. They seem to worship LeetCode. They come to me with questions and I explain the approach. It got me thinking - I wonder how I would do on these platforms.

Having 5 years of industry experience in SQL, I knew not to spend too many days on LeetCode. As an obsessed gamer who spent 24-hour sessions playing chess and DotA in my teenage years, I knew I could manage sitting in front of a screen for 12 hours if it was interesting enough to get me obsessed again in my mid-20s.

On the night of 11th March 2021, I grabbed a big bowl of fruits, water, and some snacks for a 12-hour challenge that I set for myself to complete all SQL problems on LeetCode. Immediately, I noticed a problem! A total of 152 problems meant that I had approximately 4 minutes for each. An unrealistic and silly goal given that it takes a couple of minutes to read and understand a problem. So, I changed the goal to “solving as much as I can in 12 hours”.

Below are some of the questions that I noticed many of my classmates/friends have:

- Q1. As a beginner, where do I start?
  - A basic understanding of discrete mathematics - set theory is a must before you start with SQL. Also, theory on RDBMS.

- Q2. I end up with a wrong solution even when I’m confident with the theory. What am I doing wrong here?
  -   You’re not wrong, it's LeetCode! Few problems and test cases are unnecessarily tricky. They are so tricky that you might NEVER come across such petty tricks in a real job. Don’t be demotivated that a website says ”WRONG ANSWER” in big bold and red font. If you are confident with your theory and code, smile and move on.

- Q3. How do I filter out good problems?
  - Problems that end with the roman number series (I, II, III, IV, V) are the best ones. They mimic real-world questions. Each table will have a great definition. The difficulty gets harder as you move on with the series. It will tell a story as you look back and it helps understand the reason behind each problem in the sequence.

- Q4. How many problems should I solve in a day?
  - Zero to infinity. You don’t have to solve any fixed number. A single problem can help you make progress more than 10 others combined.

- Q5. How long will it take to get good at SQL?
  - To start, pick 15 days and make progress each day. I’ve worked on SQL for few years and I am not good at it. Problems are tricky and I had an acceptance rate of 60% for the 85 problems that I solved. Only 51 submissions were correct on the first try. 34 required either minor corrections or debugging with test case inputs.

- Q6. What can I do to go beyond solving problems?
  - Check the discussion tab. Even if your code passed all test cases, have a look through other’s solutions for the same problem. Ask yourself why another code runs faster/slower and google every keyword. Do not just stop at understanding the functionality of the keyword, understand what is happening under the hood and check for its impact on explain plans for each code.

- Q7. Did you benefit from LeetCode as an experienced person in SQL?
  - Yes, I slapped myself few times for making stupid mistakes. I laughed at few problems because they were designed to ensure failure. Overall, it was fun!

- Q8: Should I buy LeetCode premium for a year or go for the monthly plan?
  - Its clever that they have 3-4 months price same as yearly price. 3 months is precisely how long you will need to explore a topic on LeetCode. It is safer to go for the yearly plan if you have exams and quizzes in between. However, if you are very disciplined and think you can stick to a plan, then I suggest you go for a monthly plan.

- Q9. How many did you solve in 12 hours?
  - I managed to solve 58 easy, 20 medium, and 8 hard ones.

- Q10. Did you take a break in between?
  - Yes, one at the 6-hour mark. And Another at the 9-hour mark. I am no longer that robotic teenager who can focus on one activity for a long duration. I need to chill :)

I screen-recorded my entire session. I then emailed LeetCode asking for their policy on posting it online. They mentioned that I cannot show their premium content on public websites. My solution codes are in the ‘scr’ folder. To look at the questions, you must pay LeetCode.
